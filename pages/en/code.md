In parallel to research, I love to learn new programming languages and technologies. 
Here are some of my recent acquisitions and what I did with them.

1. [Jekyll][1]: this website, with [bilingual support][1a].

2. Node.js:

** [Limdu][2a] - a machine-learning framework, used for natural-language understanding in the [negochat][2b] system.
** [Computational-geometry] - implementation and demonstration of square-covering, maximum disjoint set, and 2-D cake-cutting.
