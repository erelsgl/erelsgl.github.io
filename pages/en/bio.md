**2010-2013** I worked as a research assistant in Bar-Ilan University

[negochat][4] project - negotiation agents understanding natural language.

**2007-2010** I worked in TROS - a startup company that developed
a patented algorithm for calculating trust in social networks.

**2004-2007** I learned for a computer-science-teaching diploma
and made a living as a freelance website builder.

**1999-2004** I served in the IAF software unit and developed
some secret statistical data-fusion algorithms.

In my M.Sc. thesis, I built [the first morphological analyzer for 
modern Hebrew][5].
